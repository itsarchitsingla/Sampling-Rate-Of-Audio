# Project To Find Sampling Rate of an Audio File

## My Introduction
I am **Archit Singla**. A first-year undergraduate in **Electectrical Engineering Power and Automation** from **Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi)**.

## About Project

In this project, I wrote a code to find the sampling rate of my breathing sample.

## Steps

**1.** Record your breathing by wearing a mask and connecting a microphone to your phone/ pc.

**2.** Then copy the path of the sample and paste it in the code (filtering_frequency.py) to filter out higher frequency.

**3.** Your filtered file will be saved in the folder.

**4.** Then copy its path and paste it in breathing_sample.py, and then it will print the sampling rate.

## References and Learnings 
During my initial year as a student, I encountered challenges in utilizing GitHub and Jupyter. To address this, I independently pursued learning resources available on platforms such as YouTube and Google, enabling me to acquire proficiency in GitHub operations, including repository creation and readme file management. Similarly, I familiarized myself with Jupyter through self-directed learning, leveraging sample notebooks and supplementary references.

In the course of my research, I employed ChatGPT to enhance my understanding of concepts related to sampling rates. Furthermore, I expanded my skill set by exploring new Python libraries tailored for filtering higher audio frequencies. This project served as a pivotal learning experience, providing me with invaluable insights into professional documentation practices and the application of technical knowledge in a real-world context.
